\section{Introduction}

This is an introduction. \LaTeX\ is a \new{powerful} document
typesetting system \cite[]{lamport}. An excellent reference is
\cite[]{kopka}. The new \textsf{geophysics.cls} class complies with
the \LaTeX2e\ standard. \old{We had something else written here but
  decided to get rid of it}.
