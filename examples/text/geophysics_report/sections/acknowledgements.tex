  I want to thank all the people that supported me.
\end{summaryenv}

I wish to thank Ivan P\v{s}en\v{c}\'{\i}k and Fr\'ed\'eric Billette
for having names with non-English letters in them.  I wish to thank
\cite{Cerveny} for providing an example of how to make a bib file that
includes an author whose name begins with a non-English character and
\cite{forgues96} for providing both an example of referencing a Ph.D.
thesis and yet more non-English characters.
